# Fire-Splash
A forest fire is an uncontrolled fire occurring in nature. Sometimes, the forest fire is so large that it takes a long time for the fire fighting crews to gain control over the situation. This could result in massive destruction.
India, which saw a 46 per cent increase in the number of forest fires in the last 16 years (2003-17), witnessed a 125 per cent spike (from 15,937 to 35,888) in such fires in just two years (2015 to 2017).
In 2017, the maximum number of forest fires were reported in Madhya Pradesh (4,781) followed by Odisha (4,416) and Chhattisgarh (4,373).
According to Internet and various sources of Information we come to know that 'N' number of people are dying due to unpredictable wildfires.
If we have the optimal resources and technology to predict the fire we can save 'N' number of valuable lives.
Since wild fire is a large scale physical disaster it would be effecient to have a hardware device to predict and prevent wildfire.
